You can
- upload an image, then apply any of the coded filters such as red, grayscale, rainbow, 
- upload two images, one as a message and the other as a carrier. You can encrypt the message 
in the carrier using the implemented steganography technique. 
You can also retrieve the message again.

For encryption, the size of the message should be smaller than the carrier, but does not have to be the same.
The width and height of the message are encrypted as well, to later retrieve the message in its original size.
